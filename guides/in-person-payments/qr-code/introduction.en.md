## Main characteristics

The main characteristics are:

- Operator always works from its Point of Sale system, that was previously set up with a Mercado Pago charge function. From that option, the order is sent to the associated POS.
- For a client to make a payment, an order needs to be linked to a POS.
- Operator can see the completed payment on its system.
