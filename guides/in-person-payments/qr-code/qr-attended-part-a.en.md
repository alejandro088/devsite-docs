# QR attended model

## What’s QR attended model?

After taking a client’s order, this **model allows an operator to connect the order with a Point of Sale** to complete the transaction.
This system is recommended for retail and restaurants, among others.

## Main characteristics

The main characteristics are:

- Operator always works from its Point of Sale system, that was previously set up with a Mercado Pago charge function. From that option, the order is sent to the associated POS.
- For a client to make a payment, an order needs to be linked to a POS.
- Operator can see the completed payment on its system.


## Model flow

Here's an explanation of how this model works:

> NOTE

> Note

> `pos_id` is an unique identifier of a POS inside Mercado Pago. You’ll get it at the same moment you create a POS and it’ll have an associated QR.

1. (A) Point of Sale (POS) logs the order and sends the data to merchant server.<br/>
(B) Merchant server sends order to Mercado Pago server with a `pos_id`. 
2. Order is linked to a QR code and ready for the client to scan. 
3. Client scans QR and Mercado Pago looks for the order through `pos_id`. If the client scans before the start of the order registration, flow is not affected.
4. (A) Then, merchant server gets a notification for the order. <br/>
(B) Reception is confirmed.<br/>
(C) The client will see the order to complete payment inside the app. <br/>
5. Finally, the client pays the order. 
6. (A) Client will see a payment confirmation. <br/>
(B) merchant server will receive a notification for the order. <br/>
(C) And seller will confirm reception.
7. (A) merchant server asks for order status with ID received in the last notification to know if it’s closed or still remains open.<br/>
(B) Mercado Pago returns respective data like status and payment information, among others. 
8. Once order is **closed**, receipt can be printed.
