# Cancel a pending payment

If a payment is not instantly approved, it can be created in the `pending` state. This can happen if the payment goes into manual review.

Upon approval or rejection, this change will be reported via webhook.

If after waiting for certain time you want to cancel this payment, you can call the following endpoint:


#### Request

curl -X PUT \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer SELLER_TOKEN' \
    'https://api.mercadopago.com/v1/advanced_payments/ID' \
    -d '{...}'
```
