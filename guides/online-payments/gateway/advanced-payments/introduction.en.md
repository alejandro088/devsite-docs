> This product is only available through prior contact with one of our executives.

## Introduction

The `Gateway` mode in Advanced Payments allows you to make multiple payments with different own merchant numbers and the same card token. This implies that the buyer must enter his card details only once.

To be able to make payments in this modality, you must upload your merchant numbers, agreements and associated payment methods from the configuration of your Mercado Pago account. They will be used in the integration with the API.
