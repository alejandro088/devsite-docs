# Mercado Pago Gateway: Reconciliation

> WARNING
>
> Commercial contact required
>
> This product is only available through prior contact with one of our executives.

You will find information below on how to reconcile your operations in Mercado Pago Gateway with the information of acquirers or issuers.

## Using a partner

The easiest way is working with one of our partners:

| Country| Partner |
| --- | --- |
| Argentina | [Increase](https://www.increasecard.com/mercadopago/) |

> We are working on adding more partners soon

## Using your own development or system

If you want to reconcile with a custom development or system you have two options:

### API reconciliation

By making a **GET** call to the /payments endpoint you can obtain the list of all your transactions:

```curl 
curl -X GET \
"https://api.mercadopago.com/v1/payments" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H 'Authorization: Bearer ENV_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
-d "{
  'status': 'approved'
}"
```

Each transaction (payment) will have the reconciliation information in the `acquirer_reconciliation` node:

```json
{
  "id": "",
  "acquirer_reconciliation": [
    {
      "authorization_code": "646382",
      "batch_closing_date": "2019-06-10T17:00:00.000-04:00",
      "batch_number": "017",
      "date_created": "2019-06-10T10:49:47.000-04:00",
      "date_last_updated": "2019-06-10T10:49:53.000-04:00",
      "operation": "authorization",
      "operation_status": "approved",
      "refund_id": null,
      "terminal_number": "98809468",
      "transaction_number": "0036"
    },
    {
      "authorization_code": "646382",
      "batch_closing_date": "2019-06-10T17:00:00.000-04:00",
      "batch_number": "017",
      "date_created": "2019-06-10T10:49:48.000-04:00",
      "date_last_updated": "2019-06-10T10:49:53.000-04:00",
      "operation": "capture",
      "operation_status": "approved",
      "refund_id": null,
      "terminal_number": "98809468",
      "transaction_number": "0037"
    }

  ...
