## How to offer interest-free installments

We created a tool so you can offer promotions of installments with no interest and make your business more appealing.

From your Mercado Pago account, in the section Offer interest-free installment, you can setup the number of installments you wish along with your financing cost.

Your customer pays no interest and you absorb the financing cost, therefore, please consider the [financing costs](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/ayuda/cuotas-sin-interes_3299) of the installments you want.

## How to manage customer sales on my site

In order to manage sellers and for them to be able to perform commercial transactions in your site, you must [create a Marketplace](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/online-payments/marketplace/checkout-pro/introduction).

A Marketplace is a site or app that allows you to make collections on behalf of sellers and charge a commission for each one if you wish. When a payment is generated, the money is instantly divided between your seller's account and yours.
